# Statistical_learning

In this project we will analyse data from the dataset wages. It is a subset from a U.S. survey on the labour-market which accounts not only for socio-demographic aspects but also for personal characteristics like physical appearance and health of the interviewed. There is a vast literature in social sciences on the influence of education and experience over wages. Starting from this dataset we can explore more deeply the presence of a link between wages and other attributes thanks to the structure of our dataset. Since the intrest in relationships between variables and interpretation of the results case is a relevant requirement, a linear regression will be conducted on our data. Moreover, being this an exercise to model a linear regression on “real-life” data, we will tackle problems related to the violation of the assumptions of a linear regression model based on the Ordinary Least Squares approach. We will, then, develop several models evaluating the performance of each of them. To conclude, we will show which is the most statistically sound model and, starting from it, we will draw the conclusion of our analysis.

In file Statistical_Learning_Project.R you will find the R-notebook of the project while in file Statistical_Learning_Project.pdf a written version of the project. On the other side, file wages.csv contains the dataset and wages.pdf its description.
